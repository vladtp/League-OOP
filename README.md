# League-OOP
A simulation of a MMO style game in Java. Each player can play one of the 4 different heroes, where each hero has 2 abilities.  The damage of the abilities is modified based on the type of land that the player is standing and the hero that he is attacking. Players can also level up based on the experience that they get when they kill another player.
